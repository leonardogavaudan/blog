## Leetcode

### New problems

[4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/description/)

_Concepts: Binary Search, Array_

Pretty hard problem, had to look up the solution. Solution was understandable but my no means easy to read.

[1526. Minimum Number of Increments on Subarrays to Form a Target Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-increments-on-subarrays-to-form-a-target-array/description/)

_Concepts: Array_

Easy problem, not sure why this was tagged as hard, unless I'm missing something.

[995. Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-k-consecutive-bit-flips/description/)

_Concepts: Array, Bit Manipulation, Sliding Window_

Managed to find a linear time solution but used linear space as well. Wasn't far from the constant space solution, but didn't think to reuse the argument list as space.

### Revisited problems

[380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/description/)

_Concepts: Hash Table, Array, Array Compaction_

Array compaction is important for memory management and garbage collection, so important problem to solve.

[42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/)

_Concepts: Stack, DP, Two Pointers_

Different techniques can be used, but had a hard time getting an exact solution for the two pointer solution. LLMs seem to have a hard time giving a good answer.

[1552. Magnetic Force Between Two Balls](https://leetcode.com/problems/magnetic-force-between-two-balls/description/)

_Concepts: Array, Binary Search, Two Pointers_

Highly recommended problem.

[1404. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-in-binary-representation-to-one/description/)

_Concepts: Bit Manipulation, String_

[1823. Find the Winner of the Circular Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-winner-of-the-circular-game/description/)

_Concepts: Dynamic Programming_

Hard dynamic programming problem, important to solve.
