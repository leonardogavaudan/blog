For anyone who talks with me knows that I am an avid ChatGPT user. I was initially captivated by the earlier GPT 3 release that OpenAI released to the world. Then in end of October / beginning of December 2022, they released ChatGPT 3.5 (AKA the turbo model). This was when I really got hooked. I started talking about it to everyone I could - relatives, friends, random guy sitting next to me in the airplane.

OpenAI continued releasing new features at an unbelievable pace.

-   GPT 4
-   Code Interpreter / Advanced Data Analysis
-   GPT with access to the web
-   Image generation with GPT + DALL-E 3
-   GPT-V (GPT with access to vision - meaning you can give it images)
-   ChatGPT conversations, a feature where you can talk to the bot and it will answer back

People might think that GPT 4 is the "feature" (it is more of an qualitative model improvement than a feature) that has improved my lived the most (which is true), but ChatGPT conversations is the first feature (apart from GPT 4) that has come close to bringing the same quality of life improvements.

I've recently started going on "Gawks". These are walks where I put in my earphones and have a conversation with ChatGPT. I don't have to touch my phone every time I want to speak. I don't have to read my phone while walking anymore (and bump into a parisian lampost). I can have a natural conversation with the all the of the world's knowledge concentrated in a infinitely patient and didactic model, all while getting some fresh air.
